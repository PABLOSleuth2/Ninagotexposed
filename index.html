        <p>A 15-year-old Georgian girl called Nina sexually assaulted a guy named Ersultan from Kazakhstan.</p>
        <h1>How did it happen? </h1>
        <p>The Kazakh man named Ersultan said that a Georgian girl sexually assaulted him, and her name is Nina. He exposed her by screenshotting the conversation and publishing it on TikTok.</p>
        <h1>What happened to Ersultan</h1>
        <p>Ersultan himself said that he was disgusted when Nina said very bad things to him.</p>
        <h1>So what did Nina do?</h1>
        <p>So we believe that Nina must be a predator and try to do sex things with him online.</p>
